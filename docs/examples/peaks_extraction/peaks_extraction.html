<h1>Peaks extraction methods<a class="headerlink" href="#peaks-extraction-methods" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>This notebook illustrates the use of the <em>biotuner</em> toolbox with the aims to show that we can retrieve harmonic information from a generated signal using different peaks extraction methods</p>
<p>This notebook is one step towards the exploration of biological harmonies and their relevance for the carving of new musical systems, as compared to pseudo-random generative engines.</p>

<p>First, we will generate two signals composed of two sets of predetermined frequencies. The first one will contain harmonic frequencies, while the second will contain non-harmonic frequencies</p>
